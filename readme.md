# Help with Google foobar
This repo was created with the aim to help others with some of the foobar challenges by pushing you into the right direction to assist you with the challenges. Although some argue that you should complete the challenges with no help at all, I disagree. No company would expect you to complete a project without the internet and would you really think if you worked at Google you wouldn't be allowed to Google? Rather than straight up give you the answers I have provided some steps that may assist with your path to the solution.

_To be clear: __This repository was created with the intention to assist, not provide the full answer to Google's challenges.___

## What is Google's foobar
Foobar is a web-app that posts a series of challenges which you have a set time to complete which you will be invited to participate in. These challenges can be completed in either Python or Java, most of the challenges require fair understanding of popular algorithms which are most likely used at Google. Upon completing level 3 you will be prompted with the option to send your details to recruitment which may lead up to a follow up email or phone call depending on how you tackled the challenges.

## How do I get in?
The prompt to participate in the challenges normally appears when searching for information related to programming languages Google are interested in targeting applicants for. One search that is effective is `python try catch`, just refresh the page if you do not see the prompt and make sure you give it a couple seconds to load the whole page before you refresh. You will see something like this:

## Challenges
Here are some challenges that I came across as well as an explanation on how I set out to complete some of them. Please note that these challenges can be completed in several different ways and that my way is no means the 'correct way', but simply one method of passing the test cases. Feel free to contribute to this list with a PR.
